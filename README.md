# LineCount

Counts file lines as `wc -l path/to/file` does. Supports counting of multiple files and their sum.

#### Set up
1. If you don't have Go, first install it: https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Type in terminal:
`go get https://github.com/robbydrive/LineCount`  
This command fetches, builds and installs a package. Executable is put into `$GOPATH/bin`


#### Usage:
`$GOPATH/bin/lc path1 [path2] ... [pathN]`
